Q6: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

                ANSWER

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature. These modules are designed to be cohesive, meaning that each module performs a single, well-defined task, and loosely coupled, meaning that they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces with minimal dependencies.

Benefits of Modularity in Software Design:

1. Maintainability: Modularity improves maintainability by isolating changes within individual modules. When a change is required, developers can focus on the specific module affected without impacting other parts of the system. This reduces the risk of unintended consequences and makes it easier to understand, debug, and update the software over time.

2. Scalability: Modularity facilitates scalability by allowing software systems to grow and evolve without becoming overly complex or difficult to manage. New features or functionality can be added by creating new modules or extending existing ones, rather than modifying the entire system. This modular approach supports incremental development and enables teams to scale their development efforts more effectively.

3. Reusability: Modular design promotes reusability by encapsulating common functionality within reusable modules. These modules can be easily reused across different parts of the software system or in different projects, reducing duplication of effort and promoting consistency and standardization.
